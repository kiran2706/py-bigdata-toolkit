You can do some pretty useful things with arrays like:

Finding the number of elements with ARRAY_LENGTH(<array>)
Deduplicating elements with ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT <field>)
Ordering elements with ARRAY_AGG(<field> ORDER BY <field>)
Limiting ARRAY_AGG(<field> LIMIT 5)


Recap of STRUCTs:

A SQL STRUCT is simply a container of other data fields which can be of different data types. The word struct means data structure. Recall the example from earlier:
STRUCT("Rudisha" as name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] as splits) AS runner
STRUCTs are given an alias (like runner above) and can conceptually be thought of as a table inside of your main table.
STRUCTs (and ARRAYs) must be unpacked before you can operate over their elements. Wrap an UNNEST() around the name of the struct itself or the struct field that is an array in order to unpack and flatten it.
